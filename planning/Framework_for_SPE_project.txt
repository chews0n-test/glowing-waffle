Framework for SPE project

1. Create an ANN or Response Surface for designing/optimizing a frack job
- we will choose one

2. Include uncertainty in the model - ie. multiple realizations - give a probabilistic estimate

3. What features to look at?
- fluid + completions + rock
- 

4. Outputs to look at?

5. git repository:

https://github.com/chews0n/glowing-waffle

6. start with a small lit review

7. Data? -> grab something from AccuMap or otherwise? 
- Dependant on features

8. validation -> either compare to a simulator or use another data set that wasn't used in training or both 

8. End Product should be somewhat universal -> probably require retraining for different plays (eg. marcellus vs bakken vs montney)
